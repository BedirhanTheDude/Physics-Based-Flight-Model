# Physics-Based-Flight-Model

This is a little flight model prototype based on real physics equations. The model takes in account the angle of attack of the aircraft which is found as the angle between the direction vector of the aircraft's nose and the plane's velocity projected on to the vertical 2D space. Based on this angle of attack we are able to calculate the aerodynamic coefficients from a pre calculated graph. After finding the coefficients it is just calculating and applying the forces on the aircraft. This was done in the Unity Game Engine with the C# language. This was like a proof of concept rather than a fully featured flight simulator. This is one of the stepping stones for a future project of mine. Unfortunately this is only avaliable on Windows.

# Download
You can download the project as an executable here: https://imbedo.itch.io/flight-model

## Unity
If you want to see the aerodynamic force vectors in real time you will have to download the whole Unity Project and run it on Unity.
